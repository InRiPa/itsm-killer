### Kubernetes Deployments

In this scenario, we're going to make our first `deployment` with `kubectl`.

We're doing this straight on a terminal without any additional files. 

You'll learn about:

* `kubectl cluster-info`
* `kubectl get nodes`
* `kubectl create deployment`
* `kubectl get deployment(s)`
* `kubectl get pods`
* `kubectl describe pods`
* `kubectl scale`
* `kubectl delete`
