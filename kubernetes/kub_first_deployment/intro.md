### Kubernetes Deployments

In this scenario, weâ€™ll be making our first `deployment` using `kubectl`!

Weâ€™ll keep things simple by working directly from the terminal, without any extra configuration files.

In this session, youâ€™ll explore the following commands:

* `kubectl cluster-info` â€“ Check cluster information.

* `kubectl get nodes` â€“ View your nodes.

* `kubectl create deployment` â€“ Create a new deployment.

* `kubectl get deployment(s)` â€“ Check your deployments.

* `kubectl get pods` â€“ See the running pods.

* `kubectl describe pods` â€“ Get detailed information about your pods.

* `kubectl scale` â€“ Scale your deployments.

* `kubectl delete` â€“ Remove resources.

> **NOTE!** **We just want to let you know that you are free to click on any of our commands to enhance your course experience and make the most out of it! In the future, we wonâ€™t need to remind you again â€” just know that the option is always there for you. ðŸ˜Š**
