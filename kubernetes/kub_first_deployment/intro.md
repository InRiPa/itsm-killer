### Kubernetes Deployments

In this scenario, we’ll be making our first `deployment` using `kubectl`!

We’ll keep things simple by working directly from the terminal, without any extra configuration files.

In this session, you’ll explore the following commands:

* `kubectl cluster-info` – Check cluster information.

* `kubectl get nodes` – View your nodes.

* `kubectl create deployment` – Create a new deployment.

* `kubectl get deployment(s)` – Check your deployments.

* `kubectl get pods` – See the running pods.

* `kubectl describe pods` – Get detailed information about your pods.

* `kubectl scale` – Scale your deployments.

* `kubectl delete` – Remove resources.

Let’s get started!
