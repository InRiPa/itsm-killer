# Running the first docker commands

We won’t be covering Docker installation details here. For a comprehensive guide on how to install Docker on Linux, Mac, or Windows, please refer to the[Docker Manual](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

For our first step, we’ll check if Docker is available:

* docker &rarr; This will list the available commands.
* docker version &rarr; This will show the current version of Docker.

Running `docker`{{exec}} will give us an overview of the commands you can use, indicating that Docker is installed.

Running `docker --version`{{exec}} will provide the version of Docker you have installed. This helps ensure that you’re aware of the available commands and whether you’re using a recent version.

Please make sure to run `docker`{{exec}} and `docker --version`{{exec}} before clicking on Check. This will help us confirm that everything is set up correctly.
