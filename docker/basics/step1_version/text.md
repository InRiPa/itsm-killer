# Running the first docker commands

We won't cover the "How To install" of Docker here. For more information you can visit the 
[docker manual](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to check how to install the software under
Linux, Mac, and Windows.

As first step we're going to check if docker is available
* docker &rarr; list of commands
* docker version &rarr; check current version

Running just `docker`{{exec}} gives us an indication if docker is installed as well as the commands available. 

Running `docker --version`{{exec}} gives us the current version of the installed docker software.
This is helpful to get an idea about which commands are available as well as if we're running a more recent version.
