Hello and welcome to the Git Rebase and Git Merge Course!

In this part of the course, we’ll dive deep into two essential Git techniques: **Git Merge** and **Git Rebase**. These tools are at the heart of version control, helping you seamlessly integrate changes and manage your project’s history. While both commands are used to combine branches, they work in very different ways, and understanding when and how to use each one is key to mastering Git.

Throughout this section, you’ll not only learn how these operations work, but you’ll also practice them step-by-step. Whether you’re looking to keep your project’s history clean with `rebase`, or preserve the full journey of your work with `merge`, you’re in the right place!

We’re excited to guide you through these concepts and help you get hands-on experience with both techniques. By the end of this section, you’ll feel confident in choosing the right tool for the job, whether you're collaborating on a team or managing your own project.

Let’s get started and make merging and rebasing easy and intuitive for you!
