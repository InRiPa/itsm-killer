# Git Rebase & Git Merge: Differences and Similarities

Both **Git Merge** and **Git Rebase** are used to integrate changes from one branch into another, but they achieve this in different ways:

* **Git Merge** combines two branches by creating a new merge commit that preserves the entire history of both branches. This approach is transparent and easy to track, especially in team settings, but can lead to a more cluttered history.

* **Git Rebase** re-applies commits from one branch onto another, creating a cleaner, linear history without a merge commit. This is great for simplifying the commit log but requires careful use, particularly in team environments, since it rewrites commit history.

## Key Points

**Git Merge**

* Preserves full branch history.

* Creates a merge commit.

* Better for collaboration and tracking changes.

**Git Rebase**

* Creates a linear, cleaner history.

* No merge commit.

* Rewrites history â€” requires caution in teams.

Choosing between `merge` and `rebase` depends on whether you prioritize a clear development history (`merge`) or a simplified, linear history (`rebase`).
