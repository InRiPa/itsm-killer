Hello and welcome to the Git Merge Conflict Course!

We’re so excited to have you join us as we dive into one of the most important (and sometimes tricky!) parts of working with Git: **merge conflicts**. But don’t worry! By the end of this course, you’ll have a clear understanding of what merge conflicts are, why they happen, and most importantly, how to resolve them with confidence.

Here’s what we’ll cover together:

* **What is a Merge Conflict?**
You’ll learn the basics of what merge conflicts are, why they occur when working with multiple branches, and how Git handles conflicts during the merge process.

* **Creating a Merge Conflict**
We’ll intentionally create a merge conflict so you can see it in action. Don’t worry — this is the perfect opportunity to get hands-on experience in a safe environment!

* **Step-by-Step Conflict Resolution**
Once we’ve triggered the conflict, we’ll walk through the steps of resolving it. You’ll learn how to understand the conflict markers Git provides, make the necessary decisions, and finalize the merge successfully.

By the end of this course, you'll feel more confident working with Git, knowing that you can handle any merge conflicts that come your way!

Thank you for joining us, and let’s get started with some Git magic! ✨
